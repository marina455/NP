            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>CytoSurg is a synthetic biology enabler. We are dedicated to fulfilling the unmet need for implementing complex genetic designs into gene-edited mammalian cell lines. We thereby bridge the manufacturing gap between the advances made in data-driven genetic design tools and tangible applications of genetically engineered cells.</p>
            <p>The company applies a patented single-cell bottom-up gene editing process and groundbreaking dynamic gene expression analysis capabilities to construct, evaluate, and debug complex synthetic mammalian cell lines. We are thereby effectively addressing a major pain point of current genetic engineering workflows in mammalian cell lines.</p>
            <p>Our initial focus lies in enhancing therapy manufacturing for future cures, with the ultimate goal to empower genetic engineers to concentrate on designing next-generation gene-edited mammalian cell lines, confident that their visionary concepts can be realized.</p>
